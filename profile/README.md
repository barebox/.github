barebox is a bootloader designed for embedded systems. It runs on a variety of
architectures including x86, ARM, RISC-V and others.

barebox aims to be a versatile and flexible bootloader, not only for booting
embedded Linux systems, but also for initial hardware bringup and development.

Users should feel right at home with a shell with UNIX-like virtual file system
access to hardware, Linux kernel driver API for making driver porting easier and
a subset of the POSIX C library for writing more command-line utilities.
